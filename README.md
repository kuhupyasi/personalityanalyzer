We live in the age of social media. We have now more friends than anytime earlier,
thanks to various social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter and
many more. It is therefore important and appropriate to understand more about the
commonalities that we share with our friends in terms of their behavior, choices, likes
and dislikes and so much more. The problem statement can leverage on the Big Five
personality characteristics which represent the most widely used model for generally
describing how a person engages with the world. The model includes five primary
dimensions:
• Agreeableness is a person's tendency to be compassionate and cooperative toward
others.
• Conscientiousness is a person's tendency to act in an organized or thoughtful way.
• Extraversion is a person's tendency to seek stimulation in the company of others.
• Emotional range, also referred to as Neuroticism or Natural reactions, is the extent to
which a person's emotions are sensitive to the person's environment.
• Openness is the extent to which a person is open to experiencing different activities.
Each of these top-level dimensions has six facets that further characterize an individual
according to the dimension.
